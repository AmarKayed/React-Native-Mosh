What is React Native?
    React Native is a framework for building native apps for Android or IOS using Javascript.

    Native App == It's not a Web App that looks like a Mobile App, instead it's a fully fledged Mobile Application.

    We can write the code once in React Native and it will be available on IOS and Android.

    Web Apps Languages:
        - For IOS:
            Swift
            Objective-C
        - For Android:
            Java
            Kotlin
    

    Apps that are built with React-Native:
        - Facebook
        - Instagram
        - Pintrest
        - Skype
        - UberEats


Building a React Native App:
    - Expo CLI
    - React Native CLI

    Expo is better for when we donot have any experience in Mobile Development.

    With Expo we only have Javascript code, we will not have subfolders for android or ios specifically in our project.

    This means that we cannot work directly with the Native APIs of these platforms, we can only work with what Expo gives us.


Setting up the enviroment:
    We need node version 12 or higher
        node -v
    
    Installing Expo CLI globally:
        npm i -g expo-cli

    We should also install Expo Client mobile app on our phone so we can run the app directly on our phone.

    VSC Extensions:
        React Native Tools by Microsoft
        React Native/React/Redux snippets by EQuimper
        Prettier - Code formatter by Esben Petersen
        Material Icon Theme


Setup Console Commands:
    expo init ProjectName

    Choose blank template for pur Javascript template

    The project folder must be empty in order for this to work, 
    if we choose to create the project's folder before running
    expo init .


The <View> component is like a <div> in the web world.
The <Text> component is used to display text on the screen.

React Native uses function components.


Run the React Native app:
    npm start

    This will open a website with Metro Bundler on it, thus we can view our mobile app from our computer.
    We can also scan the QR code provided in our console in order to use it on our phone.

    In the terminal, we are also provided with keyboard shortcuts to choose on which platform we want to
    run our mobile app.

    We are also provided with the logs of our app, this will be helpful to test our application.
