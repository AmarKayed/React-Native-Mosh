What is React Native?
    React Native is a framework for building native apps for Android or IOS using Javascript.

    Native App == It's not a Web App that looks like a Mobile App, instead it's a fully fledged Mobile Application.

    We can write the code once in React Native and it will be available on IOS and Android.

    Web Apps Languages:
        - For IOS:
            Swift
            Objective-C
        - For Android:
            Java
            Kotlin
    

    Apps that are built with React-Native:
        - Facebook
        - Instagram
        - Pintrest
        - Skype
        - UberEats


Building a React Native App:
    - Expo CLI
    - React Native CLI

    Expo is better for when we donot have any experience in Mobile Development.

    With Expo we only have Javascript code, we will not have subfolders for android or ios specifically in our project.

    This means that we cannot work directly with the Native APIs of these platforms, we can only work with what Expo gives us.


Setting up the enviroment:
    We need node version 12 or higher
        node -v
    
    Installing Expo CLI globally:
        npm i -g expo-cli

    We should also install Expo Client mobile app on our phone so we can run the app directly on our phone.
